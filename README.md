# Image-Caption-Generation-Using-Deep-Learning

* Performedfeature extractionon Flickr8k dataset byTransfer Learningusing pretrainedInceptionV3model.
* UsedGloVemodel forWord Embeddingfor feature extraction of captions and trained on LSTM Network.
* Few of the Predictions of captions for input image are shown below
* Some predictions are able to ccurately show the situation in the pictures whereas others are able to identify key objects in the pictures like the Bike in 3rd example
